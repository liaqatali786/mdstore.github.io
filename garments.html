                A fashion may be defined as a mode or way or manner in which a thing is done or made.<br>  Broadly, speaking it means a slight departure from the usual.  In common talk, it means following the up-to-date cut and style in tailoring standards.  Fashions change every other day.  “Fashion,” said Oscar Wilde, “is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months.” The dress of today become the ridicule of tomorrow.  The fact, however, remains that the fashions are a special feature of the modern competitive society.

                Fashions are highly short-lived and dynamic.  They change as seasons change during the year.  Life does not have a fixed set of values.  The code of conduct changes.  The ways of thought change very rapidly.  Static persons fail to keep pace with the fast changes.  Human mind likes change, movement and variety. With the gearing up of the tempo of modern life, the change in dress which the young men and women wear, comes almost unnoticed.  The change becomes the acknowledged norm of the day.</p>

	<p>Most school districts believe that what female students wear should be limited because of the distraction it causes in the classroom. “I don’t want people to see you and assume bad things about you.” (McNamara). A high school principal said as she pulled a 16-year-old out of the classroom. This happened all because the student wasn’t wearing a bra and was told to cover up. Many people think that there should be dress codes in schools and others don’t</p>

	 <p> A young female said as she spoke about how her school dress code was solely for the women. In some cases, the students are even sent home because what they chose to wear made their male teacher uncomfortable. Were they not raised to control themselves? How can a school require girls to dress a certain way, but not require the boys to act a certain way? Schools nationwide have dress codes.</p>

	<p>Girls can't dress "provocatively" because it could distract and excite the boys.” (Bates). A young female said as she spoke about how her school dress code was solely for the women. In some cases, the students are even sent home because what they chose to wear made their male teacher uncomfortable</p>
